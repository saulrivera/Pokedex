# Pokedex

This app is made for iPhone. The Pokedex shows in a CollectionView all the pokemons which are available in the resource data. Then, it uses a Detail Segue to pass the view to another which contains the datail information of the specific target got by the didSelectItemAt listener. 

The data is obteined from the API http://pokeapi.co/ Version 1.
